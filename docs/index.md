## Welcome to Euclidean Norm

Euclidean Norm is your gateway to mastering the **Python programming**, and gaining the comprehensive understanding of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision**. Our mission is to bridge the gap between basic syntax and complex model implementation through clear, structured, and practical learning path.

Whether you're writing your first line of code or building your first predictive model, this site provides a curated path to success and excellence.

## Our Learning Philosophy: The Diátaxis Framework

To ensure one's get the right information at the right time, we organize our content using the **Diátaxis documentation framework**. This methodology, developed by Daniele Procida, ensures that every article serves a specific purpose in your journey.

- **Tutorials (Learning-oriented)**: Hands-on lessons that guide you through projects from start to finish. Perfect for when one want to **"learn by doing"**.
- **How-to Guides (Problem-oriented)**: Step-by-step recipes to solve specific tasks or hurdles you encounter during coding or model building.
- **Explanations (Understanding-oriented)**: Deep dives into the **"why"** behind the code, providing context and theoretical background on each and every concept.
- **References (Information-oriented)**: Technical descriptions of the machinery, syntax, APIs, and modules, designed for quick look-up.

## Project Overview

Our curriculum is split into two core pillars:

- **Python Fundamentals**: Master the essential syntax, data structures, and logic required to become a proficient programmer.
- **Machine Learning Modules**: Transition from code to intelligence by exploring data processing, model selection, and evaluation techniques.

**Tip**: If you are a complete beginner, we recommend starting with our **Python Fundamentals** course before diving into the mathematical beauty of Euclidean distance and vector norms in Machine Learning.
